	    <h2>Pier Luigi Nervi</h2>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Born on June 21, 1891 in Sondrio, Italy and died on January 19, 1979 in Rome</li>
	      <li>Internationally renowned structural engineer and an architect for his technical ingenuity that is seen in his designs that greatly exhibits his unique structural innovation.</li>
	      <li>Studied Engineering in the University of Bologna, graduated in 1913</li>
	      <li>In Italy at that time, a building engineer might also be considered an architect.</li>
	      <li>Started the engineering and construction company of Nervi and Bartoli in Rome</li>
	    </ul>
	    
	    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
	    <ul>
	      <li>
	        “The conception of a structural system is a creative action only partly based on scientific data; static sensitivity entering in this process, although deriving from equilibrium and strength considerations, remains, in the same way as aesthetic sensitivity, an essentially personal aptitude.”
	      </li>
	      <li>
	        Architecture and engineering were two connected parts of a whole. To produce good buildings, he felt that a knowledge of materials, nature, and construction were essential to understanding architecture.
	      </li>
	      <li>
	        Architecture was a synthesis of technology and art. To find the logical solution to a limiting set of factors within a highly competitive situation was to build correctly. 
	      </li>
	      <li>
	        Intuition should be used as much as mathematics in design, especially with thin shell structures.
	      </li>
	      <li>
	        He incorporated Roman and Renaissance influences, applying ribbing and vaulting to improve strength and eliminate columns.
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	    
	    <h2>Ferrocemento</h2>
	    <ul>
	      <li>	
	        “Concrete is a living creature which can adapt itself to any form, any need, any stress” </li>
	      <li>
	        In the 1940’s Nervi developed new ideas for reinforced concrete, originally adopted by Jean Louis Lambot in 1845.
	      </li>
	      <li>
	        He invented a material that is composed of dense concrete, heavily reinforced with evenly distributed steel mesh that gives both lightness and strength. 
	      </li>
	      <li>
	        It is an extremely thin structural plate, made of small diameter wire netting layers fixed on steel bars of a wider diameter, with cement mortar used as the binder.
	      </li>
	      <li>
	        The concept was to distribute the steel in mortar in such a way as to increase the contact area between the two materials. 
	      </li>
	      <li>
	        Ferrocement can be used to mold elements of any geometric shape
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	    
	    <h2>Works</h2>
	    <ul>
	      <li>
	        In 1935, the Italian air force held a competition for a series of hangars to be built. Nervi used concrete vaults with huge spans that could be constructed at low costs, and he was commissioned for the project.
	      </li>
	      <li>
	        After World War 2, he constructed a 165 ton, motor-powered sailboat. Later he built the Nennele, an 11.6m ketch with a hull of only a half inch in thickness. For these vessels, he used ferrocemento.
	      </li>
	      <li>
	        After the war, Nervi’s development of ferrocemento had helped in the rebuilding of many buildings and factories throughout Western Europe. 
	      </li>
	      
	      <li>Projects
	        <ul>
	          <li>
	            <strong>Augusteo Cinema-Theatre – Naples (1924-1929)</strong>
	            <p>
	              This was Nervi’s first significant project. It displayed Nervi’s ability to devise daring statistically indeterminate structural solutions. In this project, he advanced his research into three-dimensional systems in reinforced concrete frames, conceived as load resistant skeletons integrated within the load bearing masonry walls.
	            </p>
	            <p>
	              The most significant structure is the roof of the vast hall, 30m in diameter, with a skylight at the center. It is composed of radial system of 18 trusses, used to cantilever a series of tapered brackets, connected at their ends by a ring that defines the central void opening.
	            </p>
	            <p>
	              The beams are the same height as the inhabitable top floor, with the diagonal braces concealed inside the walls dividing the office spaces.
	            </p>
	          </li>
	          <li>
	            <strong>Pirelli Building – Milan (1955-1956)</strong>
	            <p>
	              This is the first skyscraper in Italy. The height of the building above ground is 415ft. below ground it goes down 38ft. The architects’ basic concept consisted in a rigid solid-walled point at each end, with the maximum clear space, to be divided by movable partitions in between. This suggested completing the structure by a minimum number of large elements comparable in rigidity to the points. From this, a structure was developed consisting of four triangular ‘half-points” (two at each end) and four massive wall columns. In a design of this type it is most important to make use of the vertical loads, and carry them on elements shaped to withstand horizontal forces (wind load).
	            </p>
	          </li>
	          <li>
	            <strong>George Washington Bridge Bus Passengers’ Facility – New York City (1961-1962)</strong>
	            <p>
	              The reinforced concrete structure is carried on a multi-level steel structure which distributes the various bus lines that terminate at the George Washington Bridge terminus. The Port of New York Authority’s scheme provided for a roof formed of a series of units, alternately inclined and horizontal, with side openings to provide adequate and natural ventilation even with a light breeze. This scheme was retained, with some alterations. Two large reinforced concrete lattice beams along the two sides of the building carry the diagonally placed triangular lattice beams which support the actual roof units. These units are made up of a network of ribs, running in three directions and carrying a top slab. A spine beam, carried on a row of reinforce concrete columns, links all the diagonal beams. To deal with the requirements of statics, construction, and traffic movement, the design of these columns was very carefully studied.
